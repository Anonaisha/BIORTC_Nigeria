    "Pandas is a Python library used for working with structured data. Its main purpose is to help you load, manipulate, and clean data efficiently - especially using its core data structure, the DataFrame, which can hold different types of data and gives you powerful tools for inspecting, filtering, and transforming all sorts of datasets.\n",

    "In this lab, we are going to explore basic _pandas_ concepts, and wrangle and clean a given dataset. We will be looking at very simple datasets, stored as \"csv\" files in the folder \"datasets\", but you will learn methods that you will need to be able to process and load your own neuroscience datasets for the projects.\n",
