    "Python being used scientifically requires a good understanding of handling data. We will be using two libraries to do this Numpy. Numpy holds numeric arrays, but is written in a language called C (which is faster than Python). C is faster but harder to learn (arguibly), so Python acts as a front end between the efficiently stored arrays. The library comes with many different features for quick mathematical operations across large arrays.\n",
