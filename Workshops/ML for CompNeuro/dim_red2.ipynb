    "When working with neuroscientific data, an essential first step before modeling or analysis is **preprocessing**. This includes preparing the data in a way that allows us to extract meaningful patterns while reducing noise and complexity. In this tutorial, we will apply the techniques you have explored to real neuroscience data.\n",

    "## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with one of the most commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a linear method that finds the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is useful because it simplifies the data by projecting it onto a smaller number of dimensions while preserving as much variance as possible. This often makes it easier to visualize, analyze, and interpret complex neural data.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use neural data recorded from the prefrontal cortex of a monkey performing a working memory task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task structure is as follows: a cue is presented on the screen for 0.5 seconds, followed by a 3-second delay period—a relatively long delay compared to many primate neurophysiology studies. The task involved eight stimuli representing angular locations (0º, 45º, 90º, 135º, 180º, 225º, 270º, and 315º).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only trials in which the monkeys performed correctly were included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is organized in a dictionary, with neural activity arranged in a matrix where each row corresponds to a trial and each column corresponds to a neuron. Each value represents the neuron's average activity during a defined time window within the trial.\n",

    "the main goal of this analysis is to test whether the population of prefrontal cortex neurons maintains a stable, low-dimensional, representation of the cue during the delay period.\n",
