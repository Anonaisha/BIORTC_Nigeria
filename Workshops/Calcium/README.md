# Calcium imaging data analysis workshop

Here we will explore the data from the paper [Sequence Learning Induces Selectivity to Multiple Task Parameters in Mouse Somatosensory Cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222031602X?via%3Dihub). If you don't have access to it, you can download it [here](Sequence_learning_induces_selectivity_to_multiple_task_parameters_in_mouse_somatosensory_cortex.pdf)
