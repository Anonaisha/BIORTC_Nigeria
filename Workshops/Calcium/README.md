# Calcium imaging data analysis workshop

Here we will explore calcium imaging data from the paper [Sequence Learning Induces Selectivity to Multiple Task Parameters in Mouse Somatosensory Cortex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222031602X?via%3Dihub). If you don't have access to it, you can read it or download it [here](Sequence_learning_induces_selectivity_to_multiple_task_parameters_in_mouse_somatosensory_cortex.pdf), or click above, where you see the title of the paper. 

As dataset for this task, we selected a subset of S1 neurons from trained mice, which you can download [here](https://github.com/shepai/BIORTC_Nigeria/raw/refs/heads/main/Workshops/Calcium/calcium_traces_data.zip) (you can also find it above as "calcium_traces_data.zip". To download it, simply click on "View raw"). 

What are you waiting for? Head over to [your first workshop](calcium_workshop.ipynb) to find out how to analyse this data!
