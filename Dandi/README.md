# The DANDI tutorial

This folder is meant to get you familiarized with the [DANDI archive](https://dandiarchive.org/). An archive that stores openly available neuroscience datasets in the NWB file format. This allows for streamlined data storage in a similar file format for ease of use between labs.

## Getting an overview of the available data

Browsing the data is possible either manually on the [DANDI archive](https://dandiarchive.org/) or computationally. I made a little jupyter notebook where you can see how to load the data sets via the dandi python toolbox and screen how many datasets and what type of data are available.
The tutorial can be run in google colab [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shepai/BIORTC_Nigeria/blob/main/Dandi/BrowseDandiData.ipynb)

## Loading a specific data set

To load a specific data set and getting started with re-analyzing data. I created an example notebook [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shepai/BIORTC_Nigeria/blob/main/Dandi/DrosophilaAttractorTutorial.ipynb). It covers how to load a drosophila data set, load behavioral and neural data and relate the two. If you're struggeling with the tutrorial, the solution can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shepai/BIORTC_Nigeria/blob/main/Dandi/DrosophilaAttractorTutorialSolution.ipynb)
